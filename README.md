CodeAlpha Internship â€“ Python Projects (May 15 to June 15, 2025)

Welcome! This repo contains all three Python-based tasks I completed during my internship with CodeAlpha.

I followed a consistent structure for each project:
- Understood the problem 
- Created a flowchart to map the logic 
- Broke down tasks step-by-step 
- Wrote clean, functional code 

 Task 1: Hangman Game

A terminal-based hangman game with 7 lives and tech-based wordlist.

How to Run 
navigate to hangman task folder
python generate_wordlist.py     # Generates the wordlist file
python hangman.py               # Starts the game
